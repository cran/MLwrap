\description{
This dataset, included in the tidyML package, is a simulated dataset (Martínez et al., 2025) designed to capture
relationships among psychological and demographic variables influencing psychological wellbeing, the primary
outcome variable. It comprises data for 1,000 individuals.
}
\details{
The predictor variables include gender (50.7\% female), age (range: 18-85 years, mean = 51.63, median = 52,
SD = 17.11), and socioeconomic status, categorized as Low (n = 343), Medium (n = 347), and High (n = 310).
Additional predictors are emotional intelligence (range: 24-120, mean = 71.97, median = 71, SD = 23.79),
resilience (range: 4-20, mean = 11.93, median = 12, SD = 4.46), life satisfaction (range: 5-35, mean = 20.09,
median = 20, SD = 7.42), and depression (range: 0-63, mean = 31.45, median = 32, SD = 14.85). The primary
outcome variable is emotional wellbeing, measured on a scale from 0 to 100 (mean = 50.22, median = 49,
SD = 24.45).

The dataset incorporates correlations as conditions for the simulation. Psychological wellbeing is positively
correlated with emotional intelligence (r = 0.50), resilience (r = 0.40), and life satisfaction (r = 0.60),
indicating that higher levels of these factors are associated with better emotional health outcomes. Conversely,
a strong negative correlation exists between depression and psychological wellbeing (r = -0.80), suggesting that
higher depression scores are linked to lower emotional wellbeing. Age shows a slight positive correlation with
emotional wellbeing (r = 0.15), reflecting the expectation that older individuals might experience greater
emotional stability. Gender and socioeconomic status are included as potential predictors, but the simulation
assumes no statistically significant differences in psychological wellbeing across these categories.

Additionally, the dataset includes categorical transformations of psychological wellbeing into binary and
polytomous formats: a binary version ("Low" = 477, "High" = 523) and a polytomous version with four levels:
"Low" (n = 161), "Somewhat" (n = 351), "Quite a bit" (n = 330), and "Very much" (n = 158). The polytomous
transformation uses the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles as thresholds for categorizing psychological wellbeing
scores. These transformations enable analyses using machine learning models for regression (continuous outcome)
and classification (binary or polytomous outcomes) tasks.

This paper is also interesting for ML users as it serves as a primer for estimating ML models using Python
code, particularly in the context of Social, Health, and Behavioral research.
